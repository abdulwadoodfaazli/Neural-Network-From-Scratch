# Building a neural network for binary classification from scratch

This repository consists of 2 parts: 
- `\building` for building our neural networks (one will be a 2-layer network, while the other will be L-layer network)
-  `\running` for testing our neural networks on binary classification for cat and non-cat images.

Detailed explanation and visuals for almost every code cell are provided in both files, feel free to check them out!

## General Overview:

### Task: 
To classifiy cat and non-cat images. We'll be using ReLU activation function for hidden layers and Sigmoid activation function for output layer. It will look something like this:

### Inner workings of 2-layer network:

### Inner workings of L-layer network:

<br>This project has been built under the first course "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" in the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization, offered by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) and taught by Andrew Ng himself.
